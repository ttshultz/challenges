Maze Solver by Travis
January 2014

Requires
--------
Python 2.4+
HTML5-enabled web browser (Chrome, Firefox, IE 11)

To Run
------
Open the "web" folder
Launch start.bat (runs a simple built-in python webserver)
Open in Chrome: 127.0.0.1:8000 (/index.html)

Notes
-----
All the magic is done in 3 files (maze.dart, index.html, maze.css)

If you don't have Python, you could put the mongoose tiny executable in the web folder and run that instead.
Mongoose available from http://cesanta.com/#downloads

maze.html is included for those who want to install the Dart IDE. (normally, you'd use index.html)

maze.dart is compiled to javascript for running in the browser. Although dart, can run in a browser, it's currently only by developer builds of the Dartium browser from Google.
